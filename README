CreditCard.validate('1111 2222 3333 4444') -> true/false
  the given string is automatically stripped of whitespace, so it can be
  plugged directly into form validations

The following things are tested:
  1. does the luhn validation code add up? (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)
  2. does the number range and length seem right? (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_card_number)
  3. is it one of several well-known test numbers?

Card identification via CreditCard.type(string) -> "Visa", "MasterCard", etc.
Also, CreditCard.isVisa(string) -> true/false (works for all cards given in CARDS)

Be sure to adapt the CARDS array to the credit cards you accept.

Modifications by John Bragg @ Seabright:
* There is absolutely no reason to depend on a framework for this, so I made it in raw JS. WAY more useful :) . It still passes all tests.
